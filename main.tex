%Packages are included below, these are akin to libraries in other programming languages. As far as I can tell, there is no reason to reduce the number of packages included in a document. It might compile faster, but overleaf compiles fast so this should not be an issue.


\documentclass[12pt,twoside]{report} %tells the compiler that this is a 'report' style document, and the main font size.
\usepackage{setspace} %allows the use of '\doublespace' to set line spacing
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %inclusion of this is optional, overleaf includes it in its compiler so it is not necessary, it may be necessary for other compilers.
\usepackage[english]{babel} %this does a few things eg allowing dates to be made by the compiler. probably best not to get rid of it
