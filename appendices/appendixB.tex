In our simulation, Poiseuille flow is generated by specifying uniform force per unit of volume. By carefully adjusting the applied force, we have achieved the desired maximum velocity at the center of the channel. Our simulation results are presented in Figure \ref{A:2}, which clearly visualizes the fluid velocity profile at various flow conditions. The velocity profile is obtained by employing a polynomial fit to the fluid velocity data along the x direction. Our graph illustrates the gradual increase of velocity along the constriction region, where it reaches a maximum value, followed by a gradual decrease to a minimum value in the remaining parts of the channel. This detailed representation of the velocity profile provides valuable insights into the Poiseuille flow behavior within the nanochannel.
